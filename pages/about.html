        I'd rather be a could-be if I cannot be an are;
        because a could-be is a maybe who is reaching for a star.
        I'd rather be a has-been than a might-have-been, by far;
        for a might have-been has never been, but a has was once an are.

        <p>I am a mother to my beautiful daughter, a wife to my loving husband, a daughter to my wonderful dad, a friend to all my buddies, and a woman who aspires to be more...</p>

        <p>I was born and brought up in India. My dad had a job that required him to move often, and so I lived in different places though never got a chance to live at my birthplace or where my mother tongue is spoken.</p>

        <p>I have an MBA in Finance &amp; Marketing, and have worked for a few years in the IT enabled services and Finance sector back when I was in India.</p>
